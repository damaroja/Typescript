Option 1: Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript

    Install TypeScript Compiler (if not already installed):
    If you haven't installed TypeScript globally yet, you can do so using npm (Node Package Manager):

npm install -g typescript

Transpile TypeScript file:
Use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to transpile your TypeScript file (Transaction.ts) into JavaScript (Transaction.js):

tsc Transaction.ts

This command will generate a JavaScript file (Transaction.js) in the same directory.

Run the JavaScript file:
After transpiling successfully, you can run the JavaScript file (Transaction.js) using Node.js:

    node Transaction.js

Option 2: Use ts-node for Direct Execution (without manual transpilation)

Alternatively, you can use ts-node, which allows you to directly execute TypeScript files without manually transpiling them to JavaScript:

    Install ts-node (if not already installed):

npm install -g ts-node

Run the TypeScript file using ts-node:

    ts-node Transaction.ts

    This command will directly execute the TypeScript file (Transaction.ts) without requiring manual transpilation.

Option 3: Integrate TypeScript into Node.js Project (recommended for larger projects)

If you are working on a larger project, itâ€™s often beneficial to set up TypeScript as part of a Node.js project. This involves setting up a tsconfig.json file to configure TypeScript compilation options and using npm scripts to manage builds and execution.

Here's a basic setup:

    Initialize TypeScript in your project:

    css

npm install --save-dev typescript

Create a tsconfig.json file:
Generate a tsconfig.json file using:

csharp

npx tsc --init

This command creates a tsconfig.json file with default settings. You can customize this file as per your project needs.

Modify package.json scripts (optional but recommended):
Add scripts to package.json for building and running your TypeScript files:

json

    {
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc",
        "start": "node dist/Transaction.js"
      }
    }

    Run TypeScript files:
        Use npm run build to transpile TypeScript files into JavaScript.
        Use npm start to run the transpiled JavaScript files.

By following these steps, you can integrate TypeScript seamlessly into your Node.js workflow, ensuring that you avoid SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier issues when trying to execute TypeScript files directly with Node.js.
